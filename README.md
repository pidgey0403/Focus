# Pearl
## A streamlined application designed to help students organize their time.

This project was designed as a revision to my original pomodoro timer that was made with vanilla HTML/CSS and Javascript. My goal for this front-end project was to learn front-end frameworks like React.js, while also building competency with other tools such as Redux and Typescript.
