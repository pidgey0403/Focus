# Focus ‚è∞

### A streamlined & user-friendly study-aid designed to bring **focus** to students‚Äô messy lives

---

This app was designed as a revision to my original Pomodoro timer that was made solely with HTML/CSS and Javascript. My newfound competency in front-end web development frameworks like React.js, and languages like TypeScript & SASS, allowed me to re-innovate my ideas and deliver a more complete product. 

## Features ü§ñ

- light and dark themes for user comfort
- customizable study durations to suit personal concentration patterns
- dynamic motivational quotes fetched using Reddit's RESTful API

## Technologies and Frameworks üíª

- [Bootstrap 5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [SASS 1.52.3](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [ReactJS 18.1.0](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Redux 8.0](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [TypeScript 4.7.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## What I Learnt üìö

- How to write modular and elegant stylesheets using SASS exclusive features such as @import, nested syntax, and variables.
- The essentials of ReactJS, including differences between functional components and class components, the use of state hooks, and the use of effect hooks for lifecycle methods inside functional components.
- Successful management of component states using the Redux store, action handlers, and reducer methods.
- How to add thoughtful type annotations to my code to improve readability and catch avoidable runtime errors via implementation of static typing.
