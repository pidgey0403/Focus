This app was designed as a revision to my original Pomodoro timer that was made solely with HTML/CSS and Javascript. My newfound competency in front-end web development frameworks like React.js, and languages like TypeScript & SASS, allowed me to re-innovate my ideas and deliver a more complete product.
